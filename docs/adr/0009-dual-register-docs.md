# ADR 0009: Dual-Register Documentation — Architect Voice and Lead Farmer Voice

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-02  
**Deciders:** Phil Mocek / kybernetes.systems

---

## Context

The Kybernetes Strategic Handoff defines two documentation registers
for the Policy Change Factory project:

**Architect voice:** Minimalist, precise, technical. Written for
developers and system operators who need to understand what a component
does and why it was built that way. Uses Gas Town's actual CLI and
config vocabulary. Tolerates jargon. Intolerant of ambiguity.

**Lead Farmer voice:** Mythic, civic, grounded in the Ordnance Manifesto
lore. Written for policy practitioners, advocates, and community stewards
who are not expected to read Go code or Terraform HCL. Uses the Rig,
Policy, Role vocabulary. Conveys purpose and legitimacy, not mechanism.

These voices serve different audiences and must not be mixed within a
single document.

## Decision

**Documentation is partitioned by layer:**

| Artifact | Voice | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| ADRs (`docs/adr/`) | Architect | Developers, future maintainers |
| Provider schema descriptions | Architect | Terraform operators |
| `docs/resources/*.md` (generated) | Architect | Terraform operators |
| `README.md` (root) | Architect | Developers, onboarding |
| `docs/civic/` (separate tree) | Lead Farmer | Policy practitioners, advocates |
| HANDOFF.md | Architect | Claude Code / AI coding agents |

The `docs/civic/` tree is not generated by `tfplugindocs`. It is written
by hand. It contains:

- `docs/civic/overview.md` — The Policy Change Factory mission statement
  in Lead Farmer voice, referencing the Ordnance Manifesto
- `docs/civic/ordinance.md` — How Terraform resources map to civic
  primitives (Rig, Policy, Role), with the explicit lore-to-technical
  mapping table from ADR 0002
- `docs/civic/3-minute-purge.md` — The 3-Minute Purge Standard
  explained operationally: what it means in Beads terms, how it is
  enforced by Mayor agent logic, and why it is not a Terraform attribute

## Rationale

Mixing registers produces documents that satisfy neither audience.
A policy practitioner confronted with `gt rig dock --json` loses the
thread. A Terraform operator confronted with "the farmhands who defend
the yield" cannot derive a valid HCL configuration.

Separating the registers by directory makes it clear which documents
are maintained by code generation and which require human editorial
attention.

## Lore-to-Technical Mapping (Authoritative)

This table is the normative reference. ADR 0002 is the decision record;
this is the lookup table.

| Manifesto Term | Technical Referent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| The Town | `gastown_hq` | HQ workspace root. One per deployment. |
| The Rig | `gastown_rig` | Project container. Many per town. |
| The Crew / Role | `gastown_crew` | Persistent human workspace. Many per rig. |
| The Polecat | Ephemeral agent | Runtime only. No Terraform resource. |
| The Policy | Bead (`bd`) | Operational work unit. Not Terraform. |
| The Formula | `.beads/formulas/*.toml` | Future `gastown_formula` resource. |
| The 3-Minute Purge | Mayor agent behavior | Bead layer. Not Terraform. |
| Parked | `gt rig park` (wisp) | Ephemeral local stop. |
| Docked | `gt rig dock` (bead) | Global persistent shutdown. Terraform delete maps here. |

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Neither audience receives documents intended for the other.
- **Positive:** The lore survives the technical implementation in a form
  practitioners can read.
- **Negative:** `docs/civic/` requires ongoing editorial maintenance
  separate from code generation. It will drift if not updated when the
  architecture changes.
- **Maintenance rule:** Any ADR that changes the lore-to-technical
  mapping table must also update `docs/civic/ordinance.md` in the same
  commit.
